The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC IV)^[[MIMIC IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/hosp/#files-panel)]
 data base which encompasses data from over 40,000 patients admitted to the intensive care units at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMS) between 2008 and 2019. Patient identifiers were eliminated from the database to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations, replaced by a random cipher, thereby providing de-identified integer identifiers for each patient.
